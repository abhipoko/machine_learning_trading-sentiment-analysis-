Feb 21 2025 9:30 AM ,Oil Prices Slide After Streak of Gains,"Oil is set to close out the week with a gain, marking the first upside for crude since mid-January.


Friday, February 21, 2025 The Tuesday drone attack on the CPC pipeline, Kazakhstan’s key export conduit, has set a bullish tone for this week with four straight daily gains and ICE Brent trending around $76 per barrel. In the United States, rising oil inventories were largely offset by distillate stocks slipping below the 5-year range. Overall, the average February Brent price of $75.50 per barrel is exactly where the current mood lies, indicating a stagnant short-term view. Trump Expedites Water Permits Across US. Citing its own ‘energy emergency’, the Trump administration has decided to fast-track some 700 water permits across the US, including a tunnel for Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, dredging for the Elba Island LNG project and repairs at Sabine Pass LNG. EU to Slap Sanctions on Russian Aluminium. EU member countries agreed on the 16th sanctions package against Russia, including a ban on primary aluminium imports, sales of gaming consoles to Russia as well as adding 73 so-called shadow fleet tankers to Brussels’ list of sanctioned ships. 


Oil and Biofuels Industries Join Forces on Mandates. The US oil industry, represented by the API, and biofuel interest groups joined ranks in demanding higher renewable biofuel mandates from 2026 and beyond, leaving behind decades of disputes as they jointly oppose the proliferation of EVs.Russia Extends Gasoline Export Ban. Following a string of recent Ukrainian refinery drone strikes that culminated with this week’s attack on the 150,000 b/d Syzran refinery, Russia’s Energy Ministry has extended its gasoline export ban for another six months starting in March, exempting only producers.Related: U.S. and Ukraine Discuss Critical Minerals DealUS Oil Major Eyes Chile’s Lithium Bounty. US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is reportedly meeting Chilean government officials over the upcoming weeks, expressing interest in developing lithium projects in the country as it sees parallels between conventional drilling and direct lithium extraction.    Barrick Ends Months-Long Mali Dispute. Canada’s gold mining giant Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD) signed a new deal with the Malian government over its projects in the West African country, ending a two-year dispute that involved employee arrests and paying $438 million to Bamako as compensation. Saudi Aramco Seeks New Retail Markets. Saudi national oil company Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) has agreed to purchase a 25% stake in Philippine fuel retailer Unioil, marking its return to the East Asian market, some 17 years after it sold its 40% stake in the country’s only refiner Petron. Oxy Ends Years of Profits with Q4 Loss. Dragged lower by weak chemical and midstream results, US oil major Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) posted a rare loss of $297 million in Q4 2024 after the Houston-headquartered firm allocated $1.1 billion to an environmental liability increase that it disputes in court. Brazil Launches Giant Licensing Round. Brazil’s oil and gas regulator ANP has opened up 332 blocks in both onshore and offshore basins as part of its next licensing bid round, with licences to be offered as concession contracts with lower royalty rates to finally bolster waning exploration activity. Midstream Developers Mull New Deepwater Port. Coming only days after Enterprise (NYSE:EPD) shelved its SPOT project, US midstream firm Sentinel Midstream announced that it intends to take a final investment decision on its Texas GulfLink deepwater port in Freeport, the first onshore port to load a VLCC.Mystery Tanker Attacks Scare Shippers. Four tankers have been hit with inexplicable explosions in 2025 to date, with Greek shipper Thenamaris reporting an incident this week with a blast on its Seajewel tanker docked in Italy’s Savona, all linked by the ships sailing to Russian ports prior to being attacked.South Korea to Build Two New Nuclear Plants. The government of South Korea finalized a new energy strategy that should lift the share of nuclear energy in the country’s energy mix to 35.2% in 2038 from 30.7% last year, envisaging the construction of two additional large-scale plants with 3.5 GW capacity. Colombia Posts Much-Needed Reserve Boost. Colombia’s state oil firm Ecopetrol (NYSE:EC) reported 260 million barrels of new reserves discovered in 2024, finally posting a positive reserve replacement ratio of 104%, however, the 1.88 billion boe in its portfolio still equals only 7.6 years of consumption.Tariff Fears Lift Gold to Another Record. Trump’s latest tariff-slapping frenzy that put cars and semiconductors at the forefront of discussion has triggered another rally in gold prices, with the bullion hitting an all-time high of $2,955 per ounce this week and being up 12% since the beginning of 2025.By Michael Kern for Oilprice.com

Feb 20 2025 7:00 PM ,AI Data Centers Bet on Next-Gen Nuclear,"Soaring demand for electricity to power the AI boom is creating a global rush to develop small modular reactors to meet the growing energy needs of the Big Tech firms with electricity that’s both reliable and low-carbon.Many start-ups in the United States and Europe are vying to become the first to not only design but also put into commercial operation the next generation of advanced nuclear reactors.


The small modular reactors (SMR) are believed to be simpler and cheaper to build and install. Because of their smaller size, it is possible to install SMRs on sites that are not suitable for bigger reactors. They are also significantly cheaper and faster to build than conventional reactors and can be constructed incrementally to meet the growing energy demand of a site.Nuclear Renaissance Despite promising advances in recent years, no one has actually launched such a micro reactor yet. However, the race has accelerated as technology giants are looking to power and cool their data centers, preferably with low-carbon energy. Renewables plus battery storage cannot meet all the growth in demand, so nuclear power has become the next best thing for Big Tech who are looking to boast AI advancements and climate commitments at the same time.The problem is that conventional nuclear reactors and sites take years, often decades, to fund and build.One mothballed reactor is being restarted in the U.S., thanks to a power purchase agreement that giant Microsoft has signed.Last year, Constellation Energy, the biggest owner of U.S. nuclear power plants, signed its largest-ever power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which paves the way for the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear plant.The tech industry, however, cannot rely on PPAs from operational nuclear reactors to cover the energy needs of their new data centers. That’s why Big Tech is investing in the start-ups that are developing smaller-scale modular reactors.Big Tech Backs Advanced Nuclear Technology Amazon, for example, invested in a financing round of approximately $500 million, which X-Energy Reactor Company raised last year. X-Energy continues to raise financing to complete its reactor design and licensing as well as the first phase of its TRISO-X fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Amazon funding will support future carbon-free projects that will use X-energy’s Xe-100 advanced SMRs.  Related: Kazakh Oil Output Hits Record High“We need smart solutions that can help us meet growing energy demands while also addressing climate change,” said Kevin Miller, Amazon’s Vice President of Global Data Centers.Earlier this month, X-Energy said that the upsized $700 million financing round would help it advance its technology development. Amazon and X-energy are collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts (GW) of new power projects online across the U.S. by 2039.


Another tech giant, Google, signed in October 2024 the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors to be developed by Kairos Power.“This agreement is part of our efforts to develop and commercialize a broad portfolio of advanced clean electricity technologies to power our global data centers and offices,” Michael Terrell, Senior Director, Energy and Climate, at Google said.In the race to commercialize the first small modular reactors, developers globally have raised at least $1.5 billion in funding over the past year to advance their technologies and projects, according to estimates by the Financial Times.Race Heats UpThe funding rounds, in many cases backed by the technology giants, add to government support for nuclear technologies in the U.S. and Europe.While the Trump Administration is skeptical about supporting renewables such as solar and wind, and especially offshore wind, the Department of Energy strongly backs nuclear power development.Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said earlier this month that DOE would “work diligently and creatively to enable the rapid deployment and export of next-generation nuclear technology.”  The funding and the support are lining up for developers of small advanced reactors. However start-ups will need much more financing to commercialize the various advanced nuclear technologies they are currently designing.The hope is that at some point in the 2030s, the world will have its first operational small modular reactor. Developers and backers also hope that SMRs will not suffer the fate of many conventional nuclear projects of recent years, which have seen huge cost overruns and have been years behind schedule.Nuclear Power To Help Meet The AI Power Demand A lot of nuclear energy will be needed in the coming years as data center demand is soaring.Nuclear power will be one of the most important new energy infrastructure that the world will need to meet the electricity demand from AI, Goldman Sachs said in a report last month.“But nuclear can’t meet all of the increased data-center power needs. Natural gas, renewables, and battery technology will also have a role to play,” Goldman Sachs Research said.The Wall Street bank forecasts 85-90 GW of new nuclear capacity would be needed to meet all of the data center power demand growth expected by 2030, relative to 2023. But well less than 10% of this capacity will be available globally by 2030.That’s why natural gas will stay in the mix, especially in the U.S., while battery storage capacity is also expected to surge to back up solar and wind power in unfavorable weather conditions, according to Goldman Sachs.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com

Feb 20 2025 11:00 AM ,Americans Brace for Higher Prices at the Pump,"Despite President Trump’s promise he’d bring down energy prices, Americans should brace for higher gasoline prices amid seasonal maintenance at refineries and outages on the West Coast. Yet even higher, prices are down compared to a year ago.“The national average has inched higher, driven primarily by sharp gas price increases on the West Coast, where refinery maintenance and outages have created a ripple effect in neighboring states, pushing prices higher in many communities,” GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis, Patrick De Haan wrote in a report this week, which warned about the spread of higher prices across regions.


“Although the surge remains isolated to the West for now, refinery maintenance will soon begin in other regions, and with the transition to summer gasoline blends underway, prices in most areas are likely to start rising in the weeks ahead,” De Haan also wrote.Typically, gasoline prices are at their lowest in early February, before refinery maintenance begins. Once it does, prices tick higher due to the temporary supply constraints. Then, in March and April, refineries begin to switch to producing summer fuel blends – these evaporate less easily than winter blends as the latter need to be suitable for use in colder weather. Driving season is also peak demand season, which tends to be conducive to higher prices at the pump. Yet the effects of this year’s seasonal supply and demand dynamics may be limited, according to analysts.Related: Goldman Sachs: Ukraine Peace Won’t Hike Russia’s Oil SupplyWhile refineries enter maintenance, “oil prices remain subdued in the low $70s as President Trump works on a potential peace deal between Russia and Ukraine — an event that, if realized, could have significant implications for oil markets in the months ahead,” GasBuddy’s De Haan wrote.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs does not expect a potential ceasefire or a peace deal for Ukraine to boost Russian oil production in any substantial way, limiting the effect on prices, at least in terms of physical market balance.“We believe that Russia crude oil production is constrained by its OPEC+ 9.0 million barrels per day (mbpd) production target rather than current sanctions, which are affecting the destination but not the volume of oil exports,” analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note this week.


However, the lifting of U.S. sanctions would make moving Russian oil around the world cheaper, effectively bringing prices lower, as noted by Bank of America analysts also this week: “Should sanctions relief allow it, we believe Brent crude oil prices could drop between $5 and $10/bbl if Russian barrels suddenly do not need to make a long journey to India or China, and more supply is suddenly made available,” they said.Geopolitics, then, should help push American prices at the pump lower or, at the very least, limit their increase during peak demand season when gas stations sell the more expensive summer fuel blends. Yet this is not the case all around. California, for one, has cemented its position as the most expensive state to drive in, with prices up by $0.41 per gallon in just the last month and $0.20 per gallon higher than a year ago, at $4.85 per gallon, according to Yahoo Finance. California piles a mass of energy transition-related taxes on fuels sold in the state.For the rest of the country, however, there is good gas price news down the road, regardless of the geopolitical situation. “US gas price averages will largely be well below $3 per gallon in the last third of 2025 unless we see a hurricane impact the US Gulf Coast,” the global head of energy analysis at OPIS, Tom Kloza, told Yahoo Finance.By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com

Feb 20 2025 1:00 PM ,Is the Era of Net Zero Pledges Coming to an End?,"Just a few short years ago BP proudly told us they were embarking on a journey – and I quote – “in support of our purpose to reimagine energy for people and our planet, and our ambition to become a Net Zero company by 2050 or sooner and help the world get to Net Zero.”This week, the oil giant revealed a sizeable slump in profits and its new chief executive had vowed to deliver “a fundamental reset”.So what’s going on? Is Net Zero falling out of fashion?As recently as 2020 BP’s annual report was dripping with feel-good sentiment about a clean energy future – in tone and design it looked more like an advert for Innocent smoothies.The firm was unambiguous; their future wasn’t in being an International Oil Company but an Integrated Energy Company. With massively ambitious plans to ramp up and up their investment in renewable energy they said that this journey will, and I quote, “require patience but will, over time, create a more valuable company for its shareholders…”


But it hasn’t worked out like that. Bernard Looney, the CEO who wanted to lead this journey has gone and his successor has been left to survey the wind turbine dotted landscape and it’s not that pretty.The company just reported a significant profit slump and a decline in revenues and the boss has now promised to deliver “A new direction for BP” – so which direction will it go in?Well, if investor Elliot Management has anything to do with it, it probably won’t be towards a clean, green future.The activist hedge fund has taken a near 5 per cent stake in the oil giant worth almost £4bn and is understood to be pushing BP to massively row back on its green investment strategy, focusing more on, well, oil and gas. Analysts cite rival Shell as an example of the wisdom of this approach, with its current CEO having reversed many of the Net Zero pledges made by his predecessor. Shell’s shares have risen sharply since the new broom came in and the business is now worth north of £160bn in contrast to BP’s £75bn valuation.This all comes at a time when the mantra in America is “Drill baby drill” – with Donald Trump promising a new golden age for American energy. Meanwhile in the UK, the government continues to insist that Net Zero is both vitally important and eminently achievable – but its biggest cheerleader, Ed Miliband, is being forced to swallow policies that rub up against this commitment – not least the expansion of Heathrow which has climate activists up in arms or up trees or doubtless, before too long, sitting in the middle of motorways again.Politically, Nigel Farage and Reform UK sense a major opportunity to make the pursuit of Net Zero a huge wedge issue and at a speech in the City earlier this week the insurgent party – which now tops the polls – said they would scrap Net Zero, calling the objective “stupid” and pledging to tax wind and solar farms out of existence. They said they were “serving notice” on the renewables industry.Now, make of this what you will, but here at City AM we’ve been inundated with pitches for comment pieces seeking to remake the case for Net Zero. A lot of people are trying to get on the front foot in this debate, making the argument that Net Zero and economic growth go hand in hand – and we’ve given space to that argument – but we’ve also given space to voices warning that while the policy itself isn’t necessarily daft, the binding targets and ‘reach it at all costs’ approach to achieving the holy grail of Net Zero is hard to justify and will come at a high cost.It’s good that we’re having the debate; policies of this magnitude and impact need to be probed, adjusted, debated. It’s clear where energy policy is moving, it’s clear where technology is going to be transformative…and of course environmental concerns aren’t dead – they’re not even dead at the major oil companies, they’re just coming up against reality. 


Now, speaking of reality – time to consider Rachel Reeves.You know it’s been a tough week for the Chancellor when the best thing that happened to her was the UK marginally, technically avoiding a recession. The latest GDP figures pointed to economic growth of 0.4 per cent in December meaning Q4 2024 was… basically flat.Stagnant is another word for it. December’s growth figure does, however, bring some modest relief to the government though it should be noted that the growth in question was pretty much driven by strong trading in pubs, bars and restaurants – Christmas, in other words, and it masks a grim reality that GDP per head fell in the final three months of the year.Economists are clear that the outlook is still deeply concerning – and as if we needed any more evidence of this the latest figures released today show that hiring continues to slump, vacancies are down, employers are braced for higher costs and regulations coming online in April – all of which will make the debate about the accuracy of Rachel Reeves’ CV feel like a comedy interlude. By City AM

Feb 19 2025 7:00 PM ,Canada Revives Old Oil Pipeline Ideas Amid U.S. Trade Spat,"The U.S. tariff threat was a wake-up call for Canadian policymakers that the federal and provincial governments may have too hastily scrapped over the past decade Alberta-to-coast pipeline projects that could have diversified Canada’s oil and gas exports.Everyone in Canada agrees that energy exports are the biggest leverage the country has in a trade war with its neighbor to the south.


Canada supplies around 60% of all U.S. oil imports. The oil province of Alberta alone supplies 56% of all U.S. oil imports—twice as much as Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq combined, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says.But the heavy dependence on the United States for Canadian oil exports has rekindled talk about resuscitating previously abandoned Alberta-to-coast pipeline projects that would give Canada access to more markets.Over the past decade, only one pipeline made it through all the protests. The Trans Mountain Expansion Project, after it was abandoned by Kinder Morgan and purchased by the federal government, tripled the capacity of the original pipeline to 890,000 bpd from 300,000 bpd to carry crude from Alberta’s oil sands to British Columbia.For other projects, it’s all just talk for now. No company is officially proposing reviving any scrapped pipeline plan, but politicians outside of Alberta have started to realize that things could change as the rules of the game have changed.Related: Goldman Sachs: Ukraine Peace Won’t Hike Russia’s Oil SupplyThere has been talk of the scrapped projects Energy East, which would have delivered oil from Alberta east to Ontario and Quebec shores, and of Northern Gateway, which would have run from north of Edmonton in Alberta to Kitimat on British Columbia’s North Coast.These two projects were scrapped between 2016 and 2017. Back then, Canada’s federal government led by Justin Trudeau was rejecting oil and gas projects on environmental grounds. In addition, green activists’ opposition in provinces other than Alberta was killing off many attempts of Alberta-based oil producers and pipeline operators to have pipelines built to Canada’s shores—and not only those going straight south to the biggest refining centers in the U.S.With tariffs and trade war back on the table for Canada’s economy, politicians and pipeline industry executives say that the narrative has shifted.Earlier this month, Canada’s Industry Minister, François-Philippe Champagne, said that the country may need an Alberta-East Coast pipeline.“Things have changed … you cannot be in the past,” Champagne told CTV in an interview on February 9.


“We cannot be dependent,” the minister said.Canadians have increased their support for Alberta-to-coast pipelines. Public support to revive Energy East has jumped to 65% from 58% since 2019, with support in Quebec growing from 33% to 47%, a new poll from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute showed last week.Northern Gateway (Alberta to B.C.) generates the support of a slight majority of Canadians, with one-quarter opposing it. Notably, Northern Gateway generates 55% support in British Columbia, with 32% opposition, the polling showed.Among all Canadians, the majority, 63%, believe the economy would greatly benefit from the expansion of oil and gas pipeline capacity, according to the poll.Compared to 18 months ago, Canadians are now also nearly twice as likely to emphasize economic growth as a key factor in deciding energy policy, with a corresponding decline in the importance of environmental concerns, a separate Angus Reid Institute poll found last week.Canadian federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said earlier this month that Canada should consider a West-East pipeline as U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs threats exposed a “vulnerability” in Canada’s energy infrastructure.“There are some vulnerabilities that we did not actually believe existed. We should be reflecting on the vulnerabilities and deciding whether there are some things we should do,” Wilkinson said.Pipeline giants, however, are less enthusiastic—they had to cancel projects due to too much regulatory burden, opposition at federal and provincial level, and environmental campaigns against pipelines.Enbridge, which had its Northern Gateway proposed pipeline scrapped by the federal government in the 2010s, says that Canada needs real change in many aspects of its regulatory and approval processes.“For us to be willing to seriously consider reinvesting in a project like that, whether it's east or west or just west, we need to see real change on numerous fronts,” Enbridge’s president and CEO Greg Ebel said on the Q4 earnings call this month.“We would need to see real legislative change at the federal and provincial government level that specifically identifies major infrastructure projects like Northern Gateway as being in the national interest and therefore legally required,” Ebel said.Permitting changes and federal and provincial support for more energy would also help the potential revival of pipeline plans, the executive added, noting that there have been positive comments from Canada’s policymakers since the U.S. tariff threats.“They're saying the right things, but it's going to take real actions, laws, regulation to attract the capital in our view,” Ebel concluded.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com

Feb 19 2025 6:00 PM ,Energy Traders Reduce Risk Exposure Amid Trump Chaos,"U.S. President Donald Trump has kicked off his second term with a bang, launching the most systemic and aggressive makeover of the American government. Trump and his allies have moved at lightning speed to force out longtime civil servants by launching a legally suspect buyout program, firing federal prosecutors who worked on criminal cases against Trump, and even attempting to unilaterally shutter the foreign aid agency USAID.Trump’s new administrative strategy closely mirrors what Steve Bannon, former chief White House strategist at the start of the first Trump administration, described as ‘flooding the zone’. Flooding the zone is an attempt to disorientate other politicians and the media by announcing so many things in a short period that it becomes impossible to react and formulate a response to everything. And now commodity analysts at Standard Chartered have pointed out that oil markets are showing signs of disorientation in the face of the sheer volume of new policy positions by the Trump administration. According to StanChart, many energy traders have responded to this chaos by reducing their risk exposure.


Related: Goldman Sachs: Ukraine Peace Won’t Hike Russia’s Oil SupplyStanChart says the disorientation is manifesting in unusually low levels of volatility. According to the commodity experts, the 30-day realized annualised Brent volatility clocked in at 16.5% at settlement on 17 February, good for a 6-percentage point w/w decline and just 1.5 ppt above a 15-month low. StanChart says a volatility range of 35-45% might be considered as roughly normal for oil, while the recent 15-25% range is unusually low. It also shows in anemic price action and lack of direction. Realized volatility is now in the lowest 2% tail of the distribution of volatility over the past 10 years.Oil price changes have been very limited over the past three weeks, especially compared to the situation a year ago. According to StanChart, further disorientation is showing in the tendency of the market to stay close to familiar ranges; for example, front-month Brent has moved through $75.10 per barrel (bbl) on some point intra-day on 11 of the past 12 trading days. Likewise, speculative positioning has fallen back towards neutral, with StanChart’s proprietary crude oil money-manager positioning index falling 9.7 w/w to a +16.7, the lowest level so far in the current year. StanChart says that many traders have lost interest in trading fixed prices since the presidential inauguration and have made a relative shift towards trading on both basisspreads and time spreads.EU Gas Inventory DrawsEU gas inventory draws have remained unusually high, with daily draws exceeding their year-ago equivalents on 60 of the past 70 days. According to Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), inventories stood at 51.76 bcm on 16 February, good for a w/w draw of 5.19 bcm and considerably higher than the five-year average at 3.48 bcm. According to StanChart, were that ratio to be maintained, Europe will finish the withdrawal season with gas inventories at just 37.5 bcm; however, the analysts have predicted that the continent will finish the season with inventories at 40 bcm, leaving 65 bcm to be added by 1 November if the EU Commission’s 90% target is to be met.


European natural gas futures remain volatile, with prices hovering around €49 per megawatt-hour, as traders assess the urgent need to rebuild storage ahead of winter. Last week, Germany, France and Italy came up with a proposal to ease EU gas storage requirements in a bid to normalize the market. Under the current European Commission regulation mandates, all EU nations are required to refill their storage caverns to 90% capacity by November, with interim targets set for February, May, July, and September. EU gas storage is currently under 45% full, making it difficult to meet the requirement of 90% by November 1. That’s well below last year's 67% mark at a corresponding point and the 10-year average of 51% for the same period. The continent’s seasonal draw has been bigger than in the previous two winters due to colder weather, lower wind power generation due to low wind speeds and the termination of Russian gas imports via Ukraine.However, LNG flows from the United States to Europe and Asia are expected to remain elevated. With Europe’s demand for U.S. LNG likely to remain robust, StanChart has predicted that displaced flows due to the latest China tariffs on U.S. LNG are unlikely to become distressed. StanChart sees the tariffs cutting the flow of spot cargoes to China dramatically, with some flows under longer-term contracts likely to continue, depending on the nature of re-export clauses. The experts have warned that the biggest threat of these tariffs is the economics of future long-term contracts, including contracts amounting to at least 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) that have already been signed. However, the U.S. currently provides less than 6% of China's LNG imports, while China accounts for just 6% of U.S. exports. By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com

Feb 19 2025 4:00 PM ,Can Uruguay Strike Black Gold? Offshore Drilling in Focus,"After decades of developing its renewable energy capacity, Uruguay is now looking to explore for oil and gas, having made no successful discoveries in the past. New hopes of offshore reserves have encouraged the government to welcome foreign oil majors into its waters to explore for crude, despite the potentially harmful environmental implications of these activities. Uruguay is located between Brazil, Argentina, and the South Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of around 3.4 million people and, despite being one of Latin America’s richest countries, around one in five children and adolescents continue to live in poverty. Like many countries around the globe, Uruguay is facing a cost-of-living crisis. 


In 2022, oil contributed 43.6 percent of Uruguay’s total energy supply, however, it accounted for just 8.9 percent of its total electricity generation. Uruguay imported 97.6 percent of its crude supply and, in 2023, Uruguay imported $1.07 billion of crude petroleum, making it the country’s most imported product. It imports around 50,000 bpd of crude, mainly from Nigeria, the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. Uruguay’s government is now aiming to make Uruguay more energy-independent in the coming years by looking into its fossil fuel potential. Somewhat late in the game, Uruguay is exploring its Atlantic waters for oil. Uruguay has never found oil on or offshore, but, its former neighbour Namibia – from when the continents were joined as part of Pangaea – recently struck black gold. While Namibia, in the southwest of Africa, is over 7,000 km away, the recent discovery of 11 billion barrels of crude offshore has made Uruguay hopeful that it might have similar luck. Santiago Ferro Castelli, an energy transition manager at the state-owned energy company Ancap, which is conducting the exploration activities, stated, “We have a very similar geology, very similar spaces.” Ancap estimates there is between a 3 and 23 percent probability that offshore areas will contain oil or gas. Uruguay’s government has awarded seven contracts for exploration projects to companies such as U.S.-based Apache, Argentina’s YPF and the U.K.’s Shell, with drilling expected to commence in 2026. All 120km2 of Uruguay’s offshore acreage will now be explored for crude. Eytan Uliel, the CEO of Challenger Energy, stated, “In less than 18 months [Uruguay] went from being unheard of [in the oil world] to being 100 percent licensed by some of the biggest companies in the world.” This move reflects the wave of exploration activities that have taken place across Latin America in recent years. Guyana has become a major area of exploration, with several international oil majors flocking to develop ‘low-carbon’ oil projects. Guyana’s neighbour Suriname has also garnered significant attention, with experts suggesting the region could replace Venezuela as Latin America’s main oil power. However, many are criticising the move, as Uruguay has made strides in green energy production for several years. In 2022, over 90 percent of the country’s electricity production came from renewable energy sources, which few countries can claim. It is surprising, given Uruguay’s track record with clean energy, that the government would pursue new oil and gas exploration activities. 


In the early 2000s, under former President Tabaré Vázquez, Uruguay was facing an energy crisis, relying heavily on neighbouring countries to import expensive oil to power the country. Vázquez enlisted the help of the physicist Ramón Méndez Galain to transform the country’s energy sector by developing its renewable energy capacity. Within a decade, Uruguay developed around 50 wind farms and rolled out hydropower projects across the country. At the time, many viewed green energy projects as too expensive or too intermittent, but the government persisted and eventually transformed the country’s power system. Galain explained, “No one believed we could do it. We needed new solutions. We needed to do things differently… Today, even members of that cabinet say to me: ‘When you were saying those things on TV in 2008, we were thinking, how are we going to explain this when we fail?’”In addition to fears of potentially undoing decades of hard work in terms of clean energy, some are concerned about the country’s lack of preparedness, having no history in oil and gas. There are no laws or regulations in place for the development of oil and gas projects, which leaves Uruguay open to be taken advantage of by foreign oil and gas companies unless the government establishes clear legislation before drilling commences. The government is, nonetheless, hopeful that developing an oil industry will help bolster the country’s economy. In addition, it hopes that energy companies pursuing oil and gas activities will also take an interest in Uruguay’s green energy offerings, as many international oil majors look to expand their portfolios. The may extend to nascent industries such as green hydrogen, as well as conventional renewable energy projects. By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com

Despite the fall, the FTSE 100 mining giant announced today in its preliminary annual results that it will pay $2.2bn in shareholder returns through cash distributions and buybacks based on its performance in 2024.“The decline in adjusted operating profit, particularly within the Industrial segment, was mainly a function of lower average energy coal prices year over year,” said Glencore CEO Gary Nagle.“Prices are currently weak amid fears of soft Chinese demand and higher Indonesian output, and the effect of tariffs between Washington and Beijing are yet to become clear,” explained Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.Glencore also operates in the nickel and lead spaces, and prices have struggled in these sectors over the last year.Analysts had been expecting a fall in operating profit in the firm’s results but are currently forecasting a rebound in the figure for 2025 thanks to a reduction in the volatility of commodity prices.Glencore’s stock price has fallen more than 10 per cent in the last year and 2.6 pe rcent since the start of 2025.


“Operationally, 2024 was a strong year for Glencore,” said Nagle. “Our Industrial assets delivered full year production numbers within their original guidance ranges, which together with the addition of EVR’s steelmaking coal volumes from July 2024, resulted in a four per cent growth in copper equivalent volumes year over year.”“Capital expenditure has been creeping up, but net debt is very low at $3.7bn and that could give Glencore room for some expansive strategic action,” added Mould.Last month, rumours emerged that Glencore was eyeing a merger with mining rival Rio Tinto, which would be one of the biggest transactions in the industry ever.The two firms are reportedly looking to join forces to better navigate the energy transition and secure access to metals necessary for renewable fuel.By City AM

Feb 19 2025 12:00 PM ,Trump Suggests Ukraine Could Have Avoided War,"U.S. President Donald Trump seems to have blamed Volodymyr Zelenskyy for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, saying he was “disappointed” that the Ukrainian president complained about being frozen out of U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the war.""Today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. Well, you've been there for three years,"" Trump said, referring to Ukraine. ""You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.""


Trump did not clarify what he meant, but he has often blamed the war on Ukraine's desire to join NATO. Experts say Russia's full-scale invasion was driven by Russian President Vladimir Putin's imperial ambitions rather than Ukraine's NATO ambition, which had little support from the West at the time.Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida on February 18, Trump also said he now feels ""much more confident"" of reaching a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine.""I think I have the power to end this war,” he said at a news conference after the high-level talks in Riyadh attended by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.Trump also said he might meet Putin this month and that he would not oppose a European move to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, an idea discussed during a European summit in Paris on February 17.“If they want to do that I’m all for it,” said Trump, before adding that the United States has no plans to contribute troops to any contingent sent to Ukraine to provide security guarantees.Trump also said that Ukraine should hold elections, saying: ""That's not a Russia thing, that's something coming from me and coming from many other countries also.""Other U.S. officials have suggested that Ukraine could hold elections following a cease-fire deal and this would be “good for democracy.""But Ukraine’s constitution bars it from holding elections under martial law, which was imposed when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and continues to this day after repeated extensions.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's five-year term was due to end in May 2024 after elections in March, and Putin has said he would not negotiate with Zelenskyy because he would not have the authority to sign a peace deal.


Earlier on February 18, after the talks in Riyadh, the first senior-level Washington-Moscow discussions since the 2022 invasion, Russia and the United States agreed to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war “as soon as possible,” Rubio said.The U.S. secretary of state also said the European Union “is going to have to be at the table at some point” because of the sanctions the bloc has imposed.Sanctions were imposed as a result of the conflict, he said, speaking in an interview with the Associated Press and CNN. “In order to bring an end to any conflict there has to be concessions made by all sides.”Rubio noted the need for improvements in how the U.S. and Russian embassies ""are able to work"" in order to create missions to support peace talks, bilateral relations, and cooperation more broadly.“If our diplomatic channels are broken, it’s going to be very difficult to consistently engage on a host of topics, including some unrelated irritants that could derail the broader talks on Ukraine,” Rubio said.He called for quick action on restoring ""normalcy"" at the embassies, adding that it would be “important to set the table for the other two things that we want to do.”Some European leaders, alarmed by the radical shift in U.S. policy toward relations with Russia, fear Washington will make serious concessions and rewrite the continent's security arrangement.U.S. national-security adviser Michael Waltz said any postwar peace guarantee would have to be ""European-led,"" echoing calls by U.S. officials for European allies to increase defense spending and praising Britain and France for ""talking about contributing more forcefully to Ukraine's security.""During the February 17 summit in Paris, European leaders expressed a willingness to offer security guarantees to Ukraine, but they warned that the level of such assurances would have to be based on Washington's participation in the event of a comprehensive peace agreement, something the U.S. president now seems to have poured cold water on.France is to host a second meeting on February 19 to discuss the war in Ukraine and European security. This time, Canada and other European countries not present at the earlier emergency summit will attend.By RFE/RL 

More Top Reads From Oilprice.comRussia Claims to Be Fully Compliant with OPEC+ Output QuotaGoldman Sachs: Ukraine Peace Won’t Hike Russia’s Oil SupplyG7 Seeks to Disrupt Russian Exports With Tighter Oil Price Cap"
Feb 19 2025 9:00 AM ,G7 Seeks to Disrupt Russian Exports With Tighter Oil Price Cap,"The Group of Seven is looking to send a big anti-Russia message on Feb. 24, the three-year anniversary of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, with a potential tightening of an oil price cap intended to further hurt revenue for Russia's war machine.Bloomberg has revealed a G7 draft statement Tuesday calling for member nations to collectively redraw the price limit, which is currently set at $60 a barrel for crude oil. The document spells out pressure for Russia to ""incentivize it to negotiate a meaningful peace"" in Ukraine; however, it's anything but clear whether this is being called for in cooperation with Trump officials, who are engaged in direct talks with Moscow.


The draft at one point references ""troops and resources on the ground, coupled with robust international oversight to monitor agreed-upon lines,"" Bloomberg writes.But based on the wording, it does seem a last-ditch parallel effort to jump-start a peace arrangement with Moscow, as European nations in particular seek a 'seat at the table' - given both Zelensky and EU officials were completely cut out of Tuesday's meetings with Russian representatives in Saudi Arabia.According to more of the content:The draft indicates the allies would “recognize” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s “readiness to engage in talks to end the war,” while warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s terms for peace “have so far amounted to Ukraine’s complete capitulation.” The draft shows the allies are planning to meet with Zelenskiy on Feb. 24.Allies will call, according to the draft, for a “common sense peace that is fair, a peace that lasts,” which would entail “a durable security guarantee.”The initial oil price cap by the Western allies, first implemented in December 2022, proved too easy for Russia to work around, as India and China have remained the biggest buyers of Russian crude, and have proven not so compliant.The outgoing Biden administration in December then sought to ratchet sanctions on Russian oil, including sanctions on Surgutneftgas and Gazprom Neft, two Russian oil firms which together account for 25% of exports. Middlemen who supply Russian oil have also been targeted.


This new planned G7 initiative would aim to severely disrupt Russian oil exports to India and China, and if successful could give Trump's team more leverage in negotiations with Moscow. But Bloomberg also notes:The allies will maintain their line that any negotiation to end the war “must involve Ukraine’s full participation,” and leave it open to pursuing Euro-Atlantic integration.It’s hard to be sure what tightening or adapting the cap would look like in practice. While a lower price could be one option, another could be to try to bolster enforcement of the current measure.During a late Tuesday afternoon press Q&A from Mar-a-Lago, Trump blasted critics of his peace plan, saying ""I hear they're upset about not having a seat. Well, they've had a seat for three years."" This was in response to Ukrainians feeling 'betrayed' by being left out of current talks with Moscow.Meanwhile, there are reports saying Trump and Putin could finally meet face-to-face by month's end, as the sides potentially progress toward a firm deal.By Zerohedge.com

More Top Reads From Oilprice.comU.S. Fuel Prices Surge On Refinery Maintenance And OutagesRussia Claims to Be Fully Compliant with OPEC+ Output QuotaGoldman Sachs: Ukraine Peace Won’t Hike Russia’s Oil Supply"
Feb 17 2025 4:00 PM ,Oil Producers Exercise Caution Despite Policy Shifts,"Ahead of his second term, President Donald Trump revived the “Drill, Baby, Drill” slogan, reaffirming his commitment to boosting domestic oil production and reducing energy costs. This policy aims to enhance energy independence, drive economic growth, and lower fuel prices for consumers. However, despite the administration’s push for increased drilling, oil producers remain cautious, emphasizing that their decisions are primarily driven by market conditions rather than political rhetoric.


Market Dynamics and Industry ResponseWorking against Trump’s pro-drilling stance is an oil market that remains relatively stable. According to Deloitte’s 2025 Oil and Gas Industry Outlook, in 2024 oil prices traded within a range of $74 to $90 per barrel, leading energy companies to prioritize capital discipline and strategic investments over aggressive expansion.Liam Mallon, President of ExxonMobil’s Upstream division, recently reinforced this sentiment, stating: “A radical change in production is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is primarily focused on the economics of what they’re doing.” Mallon’s perspective reflects a broader industry trend—oil producers remain focused on financial sustainability rather than short-term production boosts.Economic Considerations and ProfitabilityThe decision to drill new wells is fundamentally tied to breakeven prices—the price at which oil companies can cover their production costs and remain profitable. According to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey, the breakeven price for new drilling projects ranged between $59 and $70 per barrel in 2024.With West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude currently priced around $71 per barrel, new drilling remains modestly profitable but not lucrative enough to justify large-scale investment without clear demand signals. Many producers remain wary of overproduction, which could lead to another price downturn similar to those experienced in 2014 and 2020.OPEC+ Influence and Global Supply ConsiderationsAnother major factor influencing U.S. oil production is the role of OPEC+ in global supply management. The cartel’s coordinated production cuts have played a key role in maintaining stable oil prices, allowing U.S. producers to generate steady returns while discouraging excessive expansion. If OPEC+ were to increase output significantly—which they have done in the past—oil prices could dip below breakeven levels, making drilling far less attractive for U.S. companies.Additionally, global demand for oil is evolving, with energy transition policies promoting renewables and reducing long-term oil consumption projections. Some producers are hesitant to overinvest in drilling amid an uncertain demand outlook, preferring instead to focus on maintaining cash flow, shareholder returns, and measured production growth.Political and Regulatory ConsiderationsTrump’s policies seek to remove regulatory barriers to oil production, including streamlining federal permitting and reducing environmental restrictions. While these measures could lower costs for producers, they do not necessarily translate into immediate increases in drilling activity.


Regulatory relief can make operations more efficient, but as Scott Sheffield, former CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, noted in a 2024 interview: “No company wants to risk another price collapse. We are disciplined now because we’ve learned from past cycles.” This sentiment highlights the industry’s cautious approach—prioritizing stability over speculative expansion.The Investment Case for U.S. Oil ProducersFor investors, the current environment presents both opportunities and risks. Many oil companies are prioritizing dividends and share buybacks over aggressive capital expenditures, making them particularly attractive for income-focused investors.Technological advancements, such as automated drilling and AI-driven well optimization, have significantly reduced operational costs, allowing producers to maintain profitability even at lower price points. Additionally, unlike in past cycles, U.S. producers have embraced capital discipline, reducing debt and improving financial stability, which could help mitigate risks associated with volatile oil prices.However, there are also key risks to consider. The ongoing global shift toward electric vehicles and renewable energy presents long-term demand uncertainties that could impact the industry’s future growth. Geopolitical risks also remain a factor, as conflicts in the Middle East, Russia, and other oil-producing regions could lead to price spikes or supply disruptions. Furthermore, future U.S. administrations could introduce stricter environmental regulations, affecting domestic production growth and potentially increasing operational costs for producers. As a result, investors must weigh these factors carefully when considering U.S. oil companies as part of their portfolio strategy.ConclusionWhile President Trump’s “Drill, Baby, Drill” slogan embodies an aggressive approach to increasing U.S. oil production, market forces remain the primary driver of industry decisions. Oil companies are responding not to political pressure but to price signals, profitability concerns, and shareholder priorities.As the global energy landscape evolves, the focus for U.S. producers will likely remain on capital discipline, operational efficiency, and strategic growth rather than an all-out drilling surge. For investors, this means looking beyond short-term political narratives and focusing on companies with strong balance sheets, efficient operations, and consistent shareholder returns.By Robert Rapier

More Top Reads From Oilprice.comTrump Administration Cuts Spark Chaos at Nuclear AgencyWhy China is Winning the Nuclear Energy RaceAnalysts Predict Gold to Reach $3,200 Later This Year"
Feb 17 2025 3:00 PM ,"Analysts Predict Gold to Reach $3,200 Later This Year","Gold prices have already increased 10 percent in 2025 to $2,900 (£2,300), but UBS has upgraded its target price for the precious metal again.UBS analyst Joni Teves said gold has had “unprecedented market dislocations” and reached a record high in 2024, but it’s only expected to move higher in 2025.


Teves explained that the gold market is currently experiencing “deep-rooted bullish sentiment,” with the metal seen as a safe-haven asset amid a highly uncertain and volatile macro environment.“After missing several buying opportunities in 2024, investors are likely wary of repeating the same patterns and may want to take advantage of corrections sooner this time around,” she said.Teves added that with uncertainty regarding tariffs, worries that stagflation may rear its head again, and continued global conflicts, the ‘safe haven’ of gold is likely to benefit.In addition, UBS expects stronger-than-expected official sector demand, such as through China’s pilot programme, which allows insurance companies to invest in gold, which provides important support to the market.The bank’s new forecasts predict that gold will climb to $3,200 later this year, then ease down slowly, ending 2025 above $3,000.UBS noted a continued lack of investor positioning toward the precious metal, “suggesting plenty of scope to add gold to portfolios.”


Alec Cutler, director at Orbis Investments, explained that despite the surging price of gold, Western investors have largely avoided rushing into the asset class.“The number of iShares and SPDR ETF investors has been dropping for the last two years… meaning gold’s rally so far is being driven by central banks and Asian investors,” he told City AM.He said that the strong returns of the Magnificent Seven, as well as the attractiveness of crypto, had been holding investors back from gold, but this would likely shift throughout the year.Therefore, Cutler predicted that gold’s rally would accelerate further once Western investors began investing in it.Meanwhile, the UBS analysts kept their forecasts for other precious metals, like silver and platinum, unchanged.While the analysts said the other metals have the potential to outperform gold from their current levels, silver suffers from higher volatility and lower investor conviction, while platinum interest could “stay muted” due to liquidity issues, leaving them reluctant to shift expectations.By City AM

Feb 15 2025 12:00 PM ,Trump's Energy Secretary Is Betting Big on Nuclear Power,"President Trump has doubled down on his pledges to allow for more fossil fuel production and reign in green funding since he came into office last month. He signed executive orders to allow for new oil and gas exploration and boost output, as well as restrict new renewable energy projects and halt a great deal of green funding. He declared a national energy emergency on 20th January, under the National Emergencies Act, largely in a bid to support fossil fuels and condemn renewable energy sources. However, perhaps surprisingly, his condemnation of clean energy does not appear to extend to nuclear power, which is expected to flourish under the Trump administration. Chris Wright, the Energy Secretary appointed by Trump, sees commercial nuclear energy as a key power source in the future of U.S. energy. Upon taking office, he listed his priorities, which included advanced nuclear power, fossil fuels, geothermal, and hydropower. Wright’s first Secretarial Order states, “The long-awaited American nuclear renaissance must launch during President Trump’s administration. As global energy demand continues to grow, America must lead the commercialisation of affordable and abundant nuclear energy. As such, the Department will work diligently and creatively to enable the rapid deployment and export of next-generation nuclear technology.” It also says, “The Department must also prioritise true technological breakthroughs – such as nuclear fusion.”


Maria Korsnick, President and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, responded by saying, “We applaud the Senate’s confirmation of Chris Wright as Secretary of Energy. In this new role, Secretary Wright will play a pivotal role in furthering our nation’s energy and national security goals through prioritizing reliable, 24/7/365 energy generation, like clean nuclear energy. We look forward to working with Secretary Wright to continue our progress toward building the resilient, reliable, and affordable energy grid of the future.” Some expect Trump to back smaller-scale nuclear projects that are faster and cheaper to get up and running. During his presidential campaign in October, Trump pointed out in an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan that large-scale nuclear builds like Vogtle “get too big, and too complex and too expensive.” During his first term in office, Trump signed an executive order promoting the use of small modular reactors (SMRs) for national defence and space exploration. SMRs are viewed by many as the future of nuclear power as they can be developed cheaper and faster than conventional reactors and can be joined together to produce more power. Further, several non-traditional nuclear energy companies, including start-ups, without the capabilities to build large reactors are developing SMRs. The licensing process for SMRs is expected to be more streamlined than large-scale projects, allowing for faster deployment of nuclear energy across the U.S. This would help achieve Trump’s aim of providing more energy to data centres to support the rollout of complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence. Trump has also emphasised his support for national energy production and goods manufacturing. He recently requested that uranium be reclassified as a critical mineral, after the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) dropped the nuclear metal from its critical minerals list in 2022 when it deemed uranium a “fuel mineral”, meaning it no longer qualified. In his “Unleashing American Energy”, Trump asks for uranium to be put back on the list, a move that would help unlock federal funding and fast-track permitting for domestic uranium projects.The U.S. began producing its first high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) in 2023. The Biden administration supported the development of uranium projects following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russian energy. Previously, the U.S. depended heavily on Russia for its HALEU, as the only commercial producer of the fuel. Centrus Energy Corp produced the first 20 kg of domestic HALEU as part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DoE) HALEU Demonstration project at an enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio. Speaking about this achievement, Centrus President and CEO Daniel Poneman stated, “This critical milestone is essential to meeting the Department’s near-term HALEU needs while laying the groundwork for the full restoration of America’s lost domestic uranium enrichment capacity.”


The U.S. continues to import most of its uranium from Canada, Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan because it is cheaper and more abundant. U.S. companies pay a combined $1 billion a year to Russia's state-owned nuclear agency, Rosatom, importing around 14 percent of U.S. uranium and 28 percent of U.S. enrichment services. However, with sanctions on Russian energy and the potential introduction of tariffs on Canadian products, Trump is expected to support the expansion of a domestic uranium industry.  Experience from President Trump’s first term in office, as well as decisions made in the first month of his second term, suggest that, unlike other clean energy sources, nuclear power might thrive under the Trump administration. In addition to fossil fuels, Trump has voiced his support for nuclear power and has appointed an Energy Secretary who favours the power source, suggesting that the sector may grow significantly as several states continue to back clean energy projects. By Felicity Bradstock for Oilprice.com

Feb 12 2025 3:00 PM ,Chris Wright's Energy Order Prioritizes Abundance,"On February 5, 2025, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued his first secretarial order titled “Unleashing the Golden Era of American Energy Dominance.” The order outlines a comprehensive plan to accelerate domestic energy production, modernize critical infrastructure, and simplify regulatory processes. It signals a renewed focus on ensuring energy abundance and bolstering innovation in the sector.Shifting Priorities: From Net-Zero to Energy AbundanceOne of the primary shifts outlined in the order is a move away from a focus on net-zero carbon policies. Rather than constraining energy production in pursuit of aggressive emissions targets, the new directive emphasizes “energy addition, not subtraction.” 


In practice, this means that the government will prioritize tapping into the vast resources of American energy. The aim is to lower energy costs for families and businesses by expanding production capabilities and reducing reliance on restrictive policies.Enhancing Research and DevelopmentCentral to the order is the call to “Unleash American Energy Innovation.” The Department of Energy is set to increase its research and development efforts, leveraging the expertise of the nation’s National Laboratories. The order calls for a comprehensive review of the DOE’s R&D portfolio, with an emphasis on technologies that can advance various energy sectors. These include advanced fossil fuel extraction methods, next-generation nuclear power, geothermal energy, and hydropower. By focusing on cost-effective, reliable, and secure energy technologies, the order aims to help maintain America’s competitive edge in the global energy market.Revisiting LNG ExportsAnother notable component of the order is the renewed focus on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The order directs the Department to process pending applications for LNG exports in accordance with the Natural Gas Act. This measure is intended to reinforce the U.S.’s position as the world’s top LNG exporter, supporting domestic energy security and bolstering international relationships, particularly with European and Asian partners.Supporting Initiatives for a Robust Energy FutureBeyond these headline initiatives, the order addresses several other important areas:


Affordability and Consumer Choice: The DOE Appliance Standards Program will be reviewed to ensure that cost-benefit analyses accurately reflect consumer needs, aiming to prevent overly burdensome regulations that could limit choice.Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR): Recognizing the SPR as a key national asset, the order includes plans to refill the reserve and review its infrastructure to better safeguard this resource.Nuclear Energy and Stockpile Modernization: The order outlines continued efforts to modernize the nation’s nuclear stockpiles and promote the commercialization of next-generation nuclear power, balancing national security and energy production.Grid Reliability and Permitting: A renewed focus is placed on strengthening the electric grid and expediting permitting processes, with the goal of removing long-standing bottlenecks that have hindered private investment in energy infrastructure.A Measured Policy ShiftWhile the language of the order is ambitious, it is framed in a way that reflects a broader policy adjustment rather than a radical overhaul. The directive provides a detailed framework for overcoming regulatory obstacles and reassigning resources toward bolstering American energy production.This new policy direction comes at a time when the U.S. remains the leading global energy producer in oil, natural gas, and nuclear power. The initiatives outlined in the order aim to consolidate that leadership by reinforcing domestic production, streamlining regulatory oversight, and promoting continued technological innovation.Looking AheadAs the Department of Energy begins to implement these policies, the impact on production, cost efficiency, and market dynamics will become more apparent in the coming quarters. Ultimately, Secretary Wright’s order represents a measured effort to recalibrate the U.S. energy landscape. By addressing regulatory barriers and redirecting focus toward energy abundance and innovation, the policy framework aims to secure a resilient energy future that supports both economic growth and national security.By Robert Rapier

Feb 11 2025 2:00 PM ,Global Markets React to Escalating U.S.-China Trade Tensions,"Via Metal MinerThe so-called “Trump Tariffs” imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump caused uncertainty in the global metals market earlier in the week. Though he did pause imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada for one month, there could still me plenty more chaos down the road.


The current tariffs include a 25% levy on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as a 10% levy on imports from China. But in a tit-for-tat move, China responded by imposing a 15% tariff on the import of U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas on Tuesday.This came alongside additional 10% tariffs on crude oil, farm equipment and some autos. According to reports, those levies will go into effect starting February 10. For now, markets and buyers have little else to do but watch and wait.Trump Tariffs Hit Global Markets, Lead to Swift RetaliationAccording to Reuters, China’s Commerce Ministry and Customs Administration separately announced export controls on key metals essential for electronics, military equipment and solar panels. Meanwhile, China’s newly announced 10% tariff on U.S.-made electric trucks could impact future sales of Elon Musk’s Cybertruck, a niche Tesla offering the brand is currently promoting across China.Experts are near-unanimous that there would be a far-reaching fallout of both the Trump tariffs and the subsequent retaliations. Many agree that the effects will impact base metal prices, trade dynamics and even global economic stability to an extent. When markets opened Monday, base metal prices on the London Metal Exchange saw a significant drop, while the prices of metals like zinc, copper and steel also traded lower. Gold Had a Good Day in Response to TariffsThere was at least one metal that managed to move north. Gold prices topped their all-time high on February 3, 2025, following concerns of inflation hurting the U.S. economy. Reuters reported that spot gold rose 0.8% to $2,818.99 per ounce by 01:45 p.m. ET after hitting a record of $2,830.49 earlier in the session. Meanwhile, U.S. gold futures settled 0.8% higher at $2,857.10.In the wake of the tariffs, fears of a new global trade war also adversely affected metal and mining company stock prices on some of the global stock exchanges. All of this only serves to underline the volatility that such tariff announcements can introduce to worldwide commodities markets. l Tariffs Affect China?Compared to his first time period as U.S. President, experts say Trump has been a bit kinder to Beijing this time, leaving the room open for further negotiations. Still, the imposition of tariffs could affect global markets in several key ways.


Exports – A percentage of China’s metal exports remain earmarked for the U.S., meaning Beijing will now have to find alternate markets.Production Costs – Increased tariffs mean more costs for manufacturers who rely on these metals for production. This, in turn, may result in higher consumer prices.Market Dynamics – Price cuts brought on by Trump tariffs could negatively impact Chinese metal producers by squeezing their profit margins.While China is still emerging from a long holiday due to the New Year, its commerce ministry has countered the U.S. administration’s move by promising “corresponding countermeasures.” The ministry announced that it would be filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization in addition to announcing retaliatory tariffs.Still, as one of the biggest consumers and producers of metals like steel and aluminum, China will certainly see impacts from the U.S. president’s decision. Analysts Predict Widespread Economic EffectsMany experts believe that the impact of the tariffs will not be limited to China alone, but will broadly bruise global trade dynamics, particularly in North America. Nearly 75% of annual exports from Canada and Mexico are to the U.S., including for metals like copper, aluminum and zinc.America also relies quite a bit on the import of auto parts from these two countries. The retaliatory measures and tariffs are bound to push costs for manufacturers in the U.S., particularly for automobiles. If companies decide to pass these increased costs on to consumers, it will have a negative impact on inflation. Most experts anticipated China’s counteroffensive to Trump tariffs. The main question on everyone’s mind was how strong the retaliation will be. An earlier report by CNN.com stated that the prevailing belief in China was that Trump might be waiting for the results of a broader investigation into U.S.-China economic and trade relations, which he initiated through an executive order on his first day in office.China Has Already Redirected Some ExportsA report in the South China Morning Post quoted economists from ING as saying that the initial 10% Trump tariffs would have a “very modest” impact on China’s economic growth. However, they noted it would further pressure low-margin exports to the U.S. and likely push some out of the market. These experts also pointed out that sectors most at risk are those with readily available alternatives, such as textiles, certain electronics and machinery.However, with tariffs in place for the past seven years, companies have already redirected many price-sensitive and easily replaceable exports to other markets. In fact, some experts believe that China will start shifting some of its metal exports meant for the U.S. to other nations. What effect the new Trump Tariffs may have on this remains a mystery.By Sohrab Darabshaw

Feb 10 2025 5:00 PM ,EU Braces for Impact as Trump Targets Trade,"European companies are trying to prepare for the fallout from President Donald Trump’s tariffs-first approach to trade policy as he finally finds the time to turn his attention to the EU after two quick wins with Canada and Mexico.Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all imports from the European Union as a way of fixing what he deems an unfair trade surplus in the EU’s favor. According to European business executives, the impact of such a move could be quite serious, the Financial Times reported last week as investment banks start revising down their economic growth forecasts for the EU.


Per the FT, Germany’s power utility RWE, for instance, worried about its investment plans for the United States, with chief executive Markus Krebber saying it might need to tweak new wind and solar projects for the U.S. because some of the components it planned to use for these projects were not manufactured locally and would need to be imported from Europe.Other companies, including luxury goods maker LVMH and supermajor Shell were considering an expansion in the United States in response to the tariffs, likely with a view to hedging against the worst of the tariff fallout. “The big question is what happens if those tariffs come in between the US and Europe,” the chief executive of Volvo Cars told the Financial Times, elaborating that anything higher than 10% would force the carmakers to boost its production in the U.S.Related: Why Tesla Sales are PlummetingNone of this sounds like a bad thing for Trump and his effort to encourage more made-in-America action. It does sound like a pretty bad thing for the European Union, at least according to banks forecasting economic growth. Goldman Sachs said the eurozone’s GDP growth could suffer setbacks, resulting in feeble growth of 0.7% this year. This compares with the 1.1% growth forecast by the European Central Bank in December.It could end up being even worse if the EU retaliates in full, according to the chief European economist of the bank. In such a scenario, which is not at all unlikely, Sven Jari Stehn foresees a full percentage point wiped out of the eurozone’s economic growth, potentially plunging the eurozone into recession.Meanwhile, the EU is preparing for retaliation—even as it makes early concessions to Trump. The Financial Times again reported that the EU was prepared to offer Washington a lower import tariff for American cars, from 10% currently to a figure closer to the 2.5% that the United States charges on car imports. That would be in addition to the EU agreeing to buy more American liquefied natural gas and military equipment.


Indeed, the EU is already buying all the U.S. LNG it can find and then some. Last month almost 90% of all U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas ended up in Europe, Reuters reported earlier this month, citing data from LSEG. The U.S. total for the month came in at 8.46 million tons, of which 7.25 million tons were shipped to Europe amid typical winter weather and plummeting storage levels due to a lack of pipeline supplies from Russia.LNG was always going to be a focal point of any trade negotiations and an easy one for the Europeans to “fix”—they already have precious few alternative options, given political animosity towards Russian gas and calls for a ban. However, the EU would need to change its tack if it wants to secure future supply—with long-term commitments.This is what the chief executive of TotalEnergies said last week in comments on EU-U.S. trade and the outlook for the bloc’s energy security. Citing the unpredictability of the global trade environment, Patrick Pouyanne urged the EU to secure supply guarantees from the U.S., pointing out, “But what happens if all of a sudden the U.S. decides they must export less than they've done historically? ... We must not pass from a so-called over-dependence on Russia to an over-dependence on another country, even if it's an ally,” as quoted by Reuters.A long-term import commitment for U.S. LNG would please Trump, no doubt, but it would be problematic for EU leaders to admit they need such a commitment for the energy security of the bloc—because of all the talk about gas being easy to give up in favor of wind and solar. The last couple of months have proven empirically this is not the case, but it would still be difficult for the political class of the EU to acknowledge that as it prepares to hit Big Tech with trade restrictions in response to Trump’s tariff plans.While the EU mulls its response to the tariff threat, Trump just went and slapped 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, including from Mexico and Canada—and from the European Union. The EU would need to think faster on its feet and maybe forego retaliation for the time being—Trump has proven he can escalate quickly and sharply.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com

Feb 10 2025 11:00 AM ,Breakaway Moldovan Region To Buy Gas Backed By Russian Loan,"Transdniestria, a breakaway pro-Russian region of Ukraine's neighbour Moldova, has agreed on a deal with a Hungarian company to buy natural gas under a loan provided by Russia. Transdniestrian leader Vadim Krasnoselsky revealed in Telegram that the delivery of gas ""was made possible by Russian credit and functional support,"" though he did not provide further details. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean says his country will not block gas flows to Transndniestria under a deal involving Hungary's MET Gas and Energy Marketing AG.


Last month, the pro-Russian region was plunged into a crisis after Russian gas exports via pipelines running through Ukraine came to a halt on New Year's Day, cut off heating and hot water supplies to households. Local energy company Tirasteploenergo urged residents to use electric heaters, dress warmly, and hang blankets or thick curtains over windows and balcony doors.


Transdniestria is, however, not out of the woods yet. According to Recean, the deal stipulates that MET Gas will supply 3 million cubic metres of gas per day starting from February 13 for only 16 days. He revealed that Transdniestria rejected an EU offer of 60 million euros to fund gas purchases on the grounds that it would have required consumers to gradually pay more for gas. ""The inhabitants of the Transdniestria region will continue to live in a state of unpredictability and worry about gas supply,"" Recean said. ""It's a solution that doesn't solve the problem long term.""Europe’s gas inventories have continued to moderate, with the latest w/w draw of 3.72 billion cubic metres (bcm) at 96% of the five-year average draw. According to gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE) data, inventories stood at 61.85 bcm on 2 February, and are 19.05 bcm lower y/y and 6.77 bcm below the five-year average. European natural gas futures climbed toward €58 per megawatt-hour on Monday, the highest level since January 2023, as colder weather accelerates the drawdown of regional storage.

Feb 10 2025 12:00 PM ,Why Tesla Sales are Plummeting,"It’s hard to believe it was ever a controversial take, but a little over two years ago, I argued that Tesla’s market share was poised to decline due to Elon Musk’s behavior. I cited a range of factors—from intensifying competition and supply chain challenges to a less-discussed (at that time), but equally important, variable: Elon Musk’s controversial acquisition of Twitter. I predicted that his behavior on the platform would alienate the very customer base most likely to purchase an electric vehicle, eventually impacting Tesla sales.I suggested that it might take a bit of time, because Tesla didn’t have a lot of competition and many Tesla orders were already in the pipeline, but I thought his actions would eventually drive customers away.


Some critics at the time dismissed this view as overly sensational. One commenter called it a “stupid and one-sided analysis”, adding “This article makes it sound like Elon Musk is ruining Tesla with his Twitter-related actions, but revenues are still up every year.”Data Validates the WarningRecent data appears to validate my previous analysis.The latest figures indicate that even though the EV market grew last year, Tesla’s 2024 deliveries dropped double digits from 2023, confirming that the company has indeed lost momentum. It isn’t just the inevitable result of a rapidly expanding EV market where more models are emerging; there’s growing evidence that Musk’s actions have actively deterred potential buyers. Now, as Tesla’s latest quarterly numbers reveal a marked decline in deliveries, it’s becoming increasingly hard to ignore the impact of Musk’s public persona on the brand. While Tesla continues to maintain a robust revenue stream, the dilution of brand loyalty is evident. The California New Car Dealers Association (CNCDA) noted, “Things aren’t looking so golden for EV automaker Tesla in the Golden State. Tesla’s dominance in the electric vehicle market continues to falter as the brand reported its fifth consecutive quarterly registration decline. Tesla’s registrations fell 7.8 percent in Q4 2024, contributing to an overall 11.6 percent decline in 2024.”Impact of Musk’s Public PersonaWhen the company once enjoyed a near-mythical status as the undisputed leader of the EV revolution, its products were not only about performance and innovation but also about aspirational branding. Today, however, that narrative appears fractured by the growing politicization of Musk.Critics have argued that Tesla’s market share decline is the inevitable result of an expanding overall EV market, with traditional automakers and startups alike launching competitive models. Indeed, the numbers reflect that the overall market is growing, which in itself presents a challenge for any single company. 


Yet, there is more to the story. The loss in market share isn’t solely a byproduct of fierce competition or production constraints—it’s also a signal that consumers are reacting to leadership decisions that seem increasingly disconnected from core customer expectations.In retrospect, my previous analysis wasn’t just a contrarian take on market dynamics—it was a warning that corporate governance and brand stewardship matter immensely. Musk’s high-profile moves have shifted public discourse in ways that extend far beyond social media. The resulting erosion of trust among a segment of Tesla’s traditional customer base is now reflected in the declining delivery numbers despite an EV market that is still growing.Looking Ahead: Rebuilding the ConnectionAs the data unfolds, it’s clear that while Tesla still delivers impressive technological advancements, the company now faces a critical juncture. The challenge is not only to sustain innovation but to rebuild the connection with consumers that once fueled its meteoric rise. In the end, the evolving narrative around Tesla serves as a reminder: even the most dominant market players must heed the multifaceted demands of modern business—where product excellence, public perception, and leadership behavior all play crucial roles. Musk’s Twitter escapade was seen as peripheral by some, but as Tesla’s latest figures suggest, they’re proving to be a factor in the company’s current market performance.While Tesla’s share price remains robust, the decline in deliveries signals that its brand is under strain. This divergence underscores a critical reality: technological prowess alone no longer guarantees market dominance. Tesla now faces the formidable challenge of re-establishing a connection with its customers while maintaining its relentless pace of innovation. As investor sentiment begins to factor in the broader implications of leadership decisions and public perception, the coming quarters will be pivotal in determining whether Tesla can reverse the trend. By Robert Rapier

Feb 10 2025 10:00 AM ,Net Zero Dreams Meet Energy Affordability Reality,"The pushback on the net zero ambitions of many countries has become increasingly evident since the energy crisis of 2022.The surge in energy prices, especially in Europe, has forced governments to address immediate concerns about the cost of living and high energy prices rather than gain more support for net-zero goals and policies.


Households and businesses are now much more focused on energy affordability than on clean energy. As a result, voters in the developed nations in recent months have chosen to punish the politicians during whose tenure energy prices spiked in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which coincided with a rise in energy demand after the initial Covid lockdowns.  Sustainability and adoption of policies to advance net-zero goals were dominating energy policy and decision-making until the end of 2021.But in early 2022, the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the subsequent end of decade-old energy routes, and the spike in oil and gas prices upended the energy debate and policy.Of the so-called energy trilemma – security, affordability, and sustainability – security and affordability became more important for policymakers and for the voters than sustainability.The most zealous advocates of the energy transition, even the International Energy Agency (IEA), admitted that the net-zero ambitions – while not scaled back by governments – have been superseded by the issues of affordability and energy access.Related: Uruguay's Green Energy Success Story Takes an Unexpected Turn“Issues of affordability and fairness have moved towards the centre of debates about clean energy transitions in many countries,” the IEA said in a World Energy Outlook Special Report on affordable and fair energy last year.In the report, the IEA defended its current stance of a proud champion and promoter of net-zero goals and criticized those blaming the high cost of living on more clean energy being rolled out.


“When people misleadingly blame clean energy and climate policies for the recent spikes in energy prices, they are, intentionally or not, moving the spotlight away from the main cause – the major cuts that Russia made to natural gas supply,” said the IEA.But the agency acknowledged, “That said, there is still an important debate to be had about affordability and fairness in clean energy transitions – notably in terms of how the costs and benefits will be shared.”The benefits are mostly shared by well-to-do households in developed countries—they can afford the high upfront costs of installing heat pumps or solar panels and, generally, of electrifying their homes. On the other hand, these high upfront costs lockout low-income households, even in developed economies, out of the transition.The costs of net-zero and greener energy are shared by everyone, but poorer countries and households feel them the most as a proportion of their disposable income.As is, the energy transition isn’t fair, and energy isn’t a universally accessible service. There are hundreds of millions of people without any access to energy, and most of these are in Africa, Southeast Asia, and many other developing countries, which lack the funding for a step change in investments. Here’s where the developed economies are asked to step in, but they haven’t been able to agree on how exactly the rich will fund the poor for energy access and clean energy.Fairness and affordability, as well as energy security in an increasingly polarized world, are leading the energy debate now.Net-zero goals aren’t deferred, but they aren’t preferred, either.In the energy trilemma, sustainability has given way to affordability and security as the more pressing issues for both policymakers and energy consumers.Energy producers are also acknowledging that clean energy will need more time to become a profitable business than initially expected. Since the energy crisis of 2022, the big European oil and gas firms have reduced investments in low-carbon energy and pledged to boost oil and gas production, in yet another U-turn of strategic priorities.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com

Feb 09 2025 10:00 AM ,Can Battery Recycling Break China's Stranglehold on Rare Earth Metals?,"Securing reliable and affordable rare earth element supplies has become a key concern in the global clean energy transition. Some have gone so far as to rebrand lithium, the third periodic element, as “white gold” due to its central role as a “critical mineral” in clean technologies including electric vehicle batteries and renewable energy storage. Speculation about the key role of lithium in a transitioning economy has led to some volatility in the market. Lithium prices took a nosedive in the past year due to a combination of soft EV sales and oversupply from China and Africa. However, lithium prices are expected to bounce back in the medium term, and the lithium market is expected to keep growing as decarbonization processes chug along around the world. 


The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that lithium demand for battery-making alone will increase by a factor of ten between 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, a 2023 report from Popular Mechanics calculated that “an electrified economy in 2030 will likely need anywhere from 250,000 to 450,000 tonnes of lithium.” That’s an insane sum. For reference, “In 2021, the world produced only 105—not 105,000—tonnes.” In anticipation of this growth trend, countries around the world have been busily trying to shore up trade relations and reliable supply chains to ensure lithium access, as well as access to other critical metals involved in producing electric vehicle batteries such as nickel, cobalt, copper, manganese, and aluminum. But one country has dominated the rare earths market – China. China alone accounts for 85-90 percent of the world’s rare earth mine-to-metal refining, and the nation’s refineries supply 68 percent of the world’s cobalt, 65 percent of nickel, and 60 percent of EV-battery-grade lithium. As a result, a whopping 75 percent of all EV batteries are made in China.There is significant concern that this gives Beijing too much leverage, and Western powers are scrambling to regain control. While the U.S. is home to abundant natural reserves of lithium, however, there are serious drawbacks to mining and extracting it. Lithium production is associated with serious health and environmental hazards and requires massive amounts of precious water resources. Extracting a single ton of lithium requires approximately 500,000 liters of water.But there could be a way to source lithium and other key energy transition metals in a way that is not only better for local communities, but more sustainable for the world in general – recycling lithium-ion batteries. A new study from Stanford University shows that on an industrial scale, battery recycling is at least 58% less environmentally harmful than mining new lithium. The Stanford researchers determined that the recycling process for lithium-ion batteries emits less than half the greenhouse gases of conventional mining and refinement processes, and uses just a quarter of the water and energy required to mine new metals.The exact greenhouse gas emissions and water impact of industrial-scale recycling would depend a lot of where the recycling plant is based, however. The plant’s green-ness is determined by the local energy mix, and impact of water usage depends on how water-stressed an area is. Battery recycling facilities will therefore have to be constructed strategically to maximize their benefit.


But the benefit of recycling does not stop at environmental stewardship. The Stanford life cycle analysis also found that expanding battery recycling could also “help relieve the long-term supply insecurity—physically and geopolitically—of critical battery minerals,” as reported by Tech Xplore.""We're forecast to run out of new cobalt, nickel, and lithium in the next decade,” said senior author Tarpeh. “We'll probably just mine lower-grade minerals for a while, but 2050 and the goals we have for that year are not far away.” Clearly, we can no longer afford to overlook the billions of kilograms of critical metals heading straight to landfills each and every year. It’s time to close the loop.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com
